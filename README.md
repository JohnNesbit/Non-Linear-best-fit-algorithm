# Non-Linear-best-fit-algorithm
Takes in data and forms a best fit algorithm by meaning together the y cordinate of all of the points within a threshold value of its current refrence point and counting that
as the y coordinate for its refrence x. It then slides +1 x and does this again until a line is constructed all across the graph. I made this up so it doesnt work great but is 
good enough for some classification and extra/interpolation.
