# Non-Linear-best-fit-algorithm
Takes in data and forms a best fit algorithm by meaning together the y cordinate of all of the points within a threshold value of its current refrence point and counting that
as the y coordinate for its refrence x. It then slides +step x and does this again until a line is constructed all across the graph. I made this up so it doesnt work great but is 
good enough for some classification and extra/interpolation.

Here are three examples of its work:

Ex1 - The first example is of a random graph whose periphery's y is multiplied by 2:

Ex2 - The second example is of a graph where y is proportional to x and then inverley proportional after 5 x with random noise.

Ex3 - The final example is y = sin 2x + noise
